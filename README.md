# Project-Intrusion-Detection-System

Hello friends,
I am Toast. I had made a project on an Intrusion Detection system using machine learning algorithms. 
Well as you know many times intrusion happens in our system so to detect it I have created a system to check it.
Now, I have written a set of codes and taken KDD-cup99 because we can not create data sets randomly easily and since we don't own this data set so we have to download it.
Now applying attacks on the data set and checking through ML algorithms which one is doing what.
I have checked various ML algorithms and got the conclusion that the decision tree algorithm is giving me the best accuracy.
I have uploaded the pics and after implementing mostly you will get same figures. It may change beacuse every system has unique processor and runtime.
